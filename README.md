# CNN_Model
Features
    Siamese Network Architecture: Uses two identical networks to compare images.
    Feature Extraction: Extracts deep features from images for comparison.
    Threshold-based Assignment: Labels are assigned if similarity exceeds a threshold (e.g., 85%).

Technologies Used

  Python: Programming language used for implementing the model.
  TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the Siamese network.
  OpenCV: For image processing and manipulation.
  NumPy: For numerical operations.
  Matplotlib: For plotting results.
  Colab: Used for running the project using GPU.

Training the Siamese Network
  This project uses a Siamese network to compare two images (past and present). The     model is trained on pairs of images, where the model learns to identify if the        images are similar or not.
